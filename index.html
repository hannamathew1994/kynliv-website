            <p>Our focus is to pioneer <strong>immunotherapeutic treatments</strong> that restore balance to the immune system. We are driven by science and innovation, and we strive to develop therapies that:</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><strong>Target specific autoimmune disorders</strong> and cancers linked to immune dysfunction.</li>
                <li><strong>Preserve the body's natural defenses</strong>, avoiding the common issues of broad immunosuppression that lead to increased risk of infections or other health complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide organ-specific immune regulation</strong>, offering patients more effective, targeted treatment options.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are committed to helping people with chronic immune-related diseases live healthier, fuller lives.</p>

        <h2 class="fade-in-title">Why KYNLiV?</h2>
        <div class="card fade-in-card">
            <p>Autoimmune diseases and cancers present some of the most <strong>complex challenges</strong> in modern medicine, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body or fails to eliminate harmful cells. While medical advances have been made, there is <strong>no cure</strong> for many autoimmune diseases, and current treatments often rely on suppressing the immune system broadly—leading to severe side effects such as heightened risk of infections and even cancer.</p>
            <p>At KYNLiV, we recognize the <strong>urgent need for more precise treatments</strong>, and our therapies aim to deliver the precision and effectiveness required to tackle these diseases at their core, <strong>without harmful side effects</strong>.</p>
